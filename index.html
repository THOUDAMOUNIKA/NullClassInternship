            <h3><u>Eye-Color Detection</u>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Eye color detection is the process of identifying the color of the iris within an image of 
                a person's face.It typically involves computer vision techniques to analyze the image and 
                extract features related to the iris.The detected eye color can provide valuable information 
                in various applications such as biometric identification systems.

            <h3><u>Baldness Detection</u>
            </h3>
            <p>Baldness detection involves analyzing images of individual scalps to determine the extent of hair loss or bald patches.
               This process often employs computer vision algorithms to identify regions of the scalp with reduced hair density or complete 
               baldness. It serves as a valuable tool in cosmetic surgery, dermatology, and personalized healthcare for assessing hair loss.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Detecting whether an individual is a child or not typically involves analyzing facial features,such as the size and shape 
                of the face, eyes, and nose. Machine learning models trained on age-related datasets can classify images based on these 
                features to determine if the person appears to be a child or an adult.This technology has applications in age verification
                for online services, child protection systems, and age-sensitive content filtering.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Voice gender detection is the process of determining whether a given audio sample corresponds 
                to a male or female speaker based on acoustic features, commonly applied in voice-related 
                applications and services.<br>[NOTE] Use the audio files in ".wav" format only

            <h3><u>Pedestrian Detection</u>
            </h3>
            <p>Pedestrian detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating 
                pedestrians within images or video frames using various algorithms and techniques, often 
                employed for applications in autonomous vehicles, surveillance, and pedestrian safety.
